Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction using IBM Watson AutoAI

Overview:
This project predicts whether a Titanic passenger would survive or not based on demographic and travel-related details such as Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Embarked. The goal is to build a complete end-to-end machine learning system using cloud AutoML and integrate it with a custom UI.

Technical Workflow:
1. Dataset (Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster) was uploaded to IBM Watson Studio.
2. Data Refinery was used for cleaning, removing irrelevant columns, and handling missing values.
3. IBM AutoAI automatically trained multiple models using feature engineering + hyperparameter optimization.
4. The best model was deployed as an online REST API in the Watson Machine Learning deployment space.
5. API endpoint and API key are used to send prediction requests.
6. A Flask-based User Interface (UI) collects passenger inputs and sends them to the IBM API for real-time prediction.
7. The UI displays:
   - Survived (1 or 0)
   - Survival probability %

Project Requirements:
→ Create a clean folder structure for Flask + UI.
→ Generate HTML/CSS UI template for input fields:
   Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked.
→ Flask backend file that:
   - Accepts form inputs
   - Builds JSON payload matching IBM AutoAI model fields
   - Sends request to IBM REST API
   - Displays prediction and probability
→ Include sample dummy input data for testing.
→ Add README with setup and run instructions.

Output:
A fully working prediction system where a user enters passenger details in the UI and receives a real-time survival prediction powered by IBM Watson AutoAI.
